                Group of Seven nations’ finance ministers discussed in a call on

                Canadian Finance Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne chaired
                the G7 meeting, which was held to discuss further measures to
                increase pressure on Russia to end its war against Ukraine,
                according to a statement from Canada, the head of the rolling G7
                presidency.
              </p>
              <p>
                The ministers agreed to speed up discussions to use frozen
                Russian assets to fund Ukraine’s defense, and discussed a "wide
                range of possible economic measures to increase pressure on
                Russia, including further sanctions and trade measures, such as
                tariffs, on those enabling Russia’s war effort," the statement
                said.
              </p>
              <p>
                U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told finance ministers
                during the call that they should join the U.S. in imposing
                tariffs on countries that purchase oil from Russia, Bessent and
                U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said in a separate
                statement following the meeting.
              </p>
              <p>
                "Only with a unified effort that cuts off the revenues funding
                Putin’s war machine at the source will we be able to apply
                sufficient economic pressure to end the senseless killing,"
                Bessent and Greer said.
              </p>
              <p>
                Bessent and Greer welcomed commitments made during the call to
                increase sanctions pressure and explore using immobilized
                Russian sovereign assets to benefit Ukraine’s defense, according
                to the joint statement.
              </p>
              <p>
                Earlier in the day, a U.S. Treasury spokesperson called on G7
                and European Union allies to impose "meaningful tariffs" on
                goods from China and India to pressure them to halt their
                purchases of Russian oil.
              </p>
              <p>
                President Donald Trump has imposed an extra 25% tariff on
                imports from India to pressure New Delhi to halt its purchases
                of discounted Russian crude oil, bringing total punitive duties
                on Indian goods to 50% and souring trade negotiations between
                the two democracies.
              </p>
              <p>
                But Trump has refrained from imposing additional tariffs on
                Chinese imports over China’s purchases of Russian oil, as his
                administration navigates a delicate trade truce with Beijing.
              </p>
              <p>
                Bessent is due to travel to Madrid on Friday for another round
                of talks with his Chinese counterpart, Vice Premier He Lifeng,
                that will cover trade issues, Washington’s demands for
                Chinese-owned TikTok to divest its U.S. operations, and
                anti-money laundering issues.
              </p>
              <p>
                Trump earlier on Friday said that his patience with Russian
                President Vladimir Putin was running out, but stopped short of
                threatening new sanctions during a Fox News interview.

                China’s exports rose faster than expected in April, while
                imports narrowed their declines, customs data showed on Friday,
                giving Beijing some relief ahead of ice-breaker tariff talks.
              </p>
              <p>
                The country’s crude oil imports in April dipped from the
                previous month but were up 7.5% year-on-year, driven by a surge
                in sanctioned shipments and stockpiling by state refiners during
                maintenance outages. [TRADE/CN]

                Separately, U.S. President Donald Trump and British Prime
                Minister Keir Starmer announced Britain had agreed to lower
                tariffs on U.S. imports to 1.8% from 5.1%. The U.S. cut duties
                on British cars but left a 10% tariff on most other goods.

                "Any more U.S. trade deals, after the one with the UK, with
                other major trading partners would have only a marginal impact
                on oil sentiment," Hari added.

                Elsewhere, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries
                and allies - or OPEC+ - plan to increase output which could keep
                pressure on oil prices. A Reuters survey found OPEC oil output
                edged lower in April as production declines in Libya, Venezuela
                and Iraq outweighed a scheduled increase in output.

                Tighter U.S. sanctions on Iran could restrict supply and push
                prices higher. Sanctions on two small Chinese refiners for
                buying Iranian oil made it difficult for them to receive crude
                and led them to sell their product under alternative names,
                sources told Reuters on Thursday.

                In the meantime, Pakistan’s armed forces launched "multiple
                attacks" along India’s entire western border on Thursday night
                and early Friday, the Indian army said, as conflict between the
                nuclear-armed neighbours intensified.

                A stablecoin launched by Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial
                crypto venture is being used by an Abu Dhabi investment firm for
                its $2 billion investment in crypto exchange Binance, one of
                World Liberty’s co-founders said on Thursday.
              </p>
              <p>
                It’s the latest in a series of Trump family crypto-related
                ventures, including a "meme coin" launched in January, that have
                drawn criticism from government ethics experts and political
                opponents over potential conflicts of interest.
              </p>
              <p>
                World Liberty, which aims to allow people to access financial
                services without intermediaries like banks, said in March it
                would launch USD1, a dollar-pegged stablecoin backed by U.S.
                Treasuries, dollars and other cash equivalents.
              </p>
              <p>
                Speaking at a crypto conference in Dubai, Zach Witkoff, a
                co-founder of World Liberty, said USD1 would be used to close
                the $2 billion investment by Abu Dhabi-based MGX into Binance,
                the world’s biggest crypto exchange.
              </p>
              <p>
                "We are excited to announce today that USD1 has been selected as
                the official stablecoin to close MGX’s $2 billion investment in
                Binance," said Witkoff, who is a son of Trump’s special envoy to
                the Middle East, Steve Witkoff.
              </p>
              <p>
                Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren sharply criticized the
                venture and pending U.S. legislation on stablecoins before the
                Republican-controlled Senate.
              </p>
              <p>
                A fund "backed by a foreign government just announced it will
                make a $2 billion deal using Donald Trump’s stablecoins," said
                Warren, a member of the U.S. Senate Banking Committee.
                "Meanwhile, the Senate is gearing up to pass the ’GENIUS’ Act -
                stablecoin legislation that will make it easier for the
                President and his family to line their own pockets. This is
                corruption and no senator should support it.”
              </p>
              <p>
                The White House and World Liberty Financial did not respond
                immediately to requests for comment.
              </p>
              <p>
                The use of USD1 in the deal highlights World Liberty’s growing
                clout in the global crypto industry, and its ties to Binance.
                USD1 is issued on Binance’s blockchain.
              </p>
              <p>
                Stablecoins are an increasingly lucrative cog in global crypto
                trading. Their issuers typically profit by earning interest from
                the Treasuries and other assets that underpin them.
              </p>
              <p>
                The value of USD1 in circulation reached about $2.1 billion on
                Wednesday, according to CoinMarketCap data, making it one of the
                fastest-growing stablecoins. The identity of its major holders,
                however, remains unclear.
              </p>
              <p>
                An anonymous cryptocurrency wallet that holds $2 billion worth
                of USD1 received the funds between April 16 and 29, according to
                data from crypto research firm Arkham. Reuters could not
                ascertain the owner of this wallet.

                Binance founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao, who was
                incarcerated in the United States last year after pleading
                guilty to violating U.S. laws against money laundering, met Zach
                Witkoff and two other World Liberty co-founders in Abu Dhabi,
                according to a photo posted on social media site X on Sunday.
              </p>
              <p>
                "It was great to see our friends," in Abu Dhabi, posted Zhao in
                response to the photo, tagging Witkoff.
              </p>
              <p>
                Zhao, who in 2023 stepped down from his role at Binance as part
                of a $4.3 billion settlement with the U.S. over the illicit
                finance charges, remains a major shareholder of Binance.

              </p>
              <p>
                Separately, Zach Witkoff announced that USD1 would be integrated
                into Tron, the blockchain of Hong Kong-based crypto entrepreneur
                Justin Sun.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sun is the biggest known investor in World Liberty and an
                adviser to the venture, according to his social media posts,
                having poured at least $75 million into the project.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sun was fighting a U.S. securities fraud lawsuit at the time of
                his first investment in World Liberty. The U.S. Securities and
                Exchange Commission in February paused its case against him,
                citing public interest.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sun moderated the panel on which Witkoff spoke on Thursday, with
                Trump’s son Eric Trump also on stage.

                Oil prices fell on Friday as traders squared positions ahead of
                an OPEC+ meeting and amid some scepticism about a potential
                de-escalation of the trade dispute between China and the United
                States.

                0922 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell

                For the week, Brent and WTI were on track for a 7% drop, the

                China’s Commerce Ministry said on Friday that Beijing was
                "evaluating" a proposal from Washington to hold talks aimed at
                addressing U.S. President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs,
                signalling a possible easing of the trade tensions that have
                rattled global markets.
              </p>
              <p>
                "There is some optimism when it comes to U.S.-China relations
                but the signs are only very tentative," said Harry
                Tchilinguirian, group head of research at Onyx Capital Group.
                "It’s still very fluid, a one step forward, two steps back
                situation when it comes to tariffs."
              </p>
              <p>
                Concerns that the broader trade war could push the global
                economy into a recession and crimp oil demand, just as the OPEC+
                group is preparing to raise output, have weighed heavily on oil
                prices in recent weeks.
              </p>
              <p>
                Complicating any talks was a threat from Trump to impose
                secondary sanctions on buyers of Iranian oil. China is the
                world’s largest importer of Iran’s crude.
              </p>
              <p>
                Trump’s comments followed a postponement of U.S. talks with Iran
                over its nuclear programme. He had previously restored a
                "maximum pressure" campaign against Iran, which included efforts
                to drive the country’s oil exports to zero to help prevent
                Tehran from developing a nuclear weapon.
              </p>
              <p>
                Oil prices gained late in Thursday’s session to settle nearly 2%
                higher on Trump’s remarks, erasing some of the losses recorded
                earlier in the week on expectations of more OPEC+ supply coming
                to the market.

                Several OPEC+ members are set to suggest the group accelerates
                output hikes in June for a second consecutive month, Reuters
                previously reported. Eight OPEC+ countries will meet on May 5 to
                decide a June output plan.

                Reuters on Wednesday reported that Saudi Arabia, de facto leader
                of OPEC+, had briefed allies and industry experts that it was
                unwilling to prop up oil prices with further supply cuts.
              </p>
              <p>
                "With non-OPEC+ supply rising robustly and global demand growth
                facing structural decline, we see no natural re-entry point for
                these barrels and, ultimately, the group will likely have to
                endure some price pain no matter when it unwinds its cuts,"
                Fitch’s BMI research unit said in a note.

                </span>
                &nbsp;is getting close to a turning point. It is currently in a
                technical vacuum following a robust recovery in late April;
                neither significant resistance nor obvious support is located
                right above it or below. A significant volatility spike that
                determines the market’s course for weeks or even months
                frequently precedes this kind of price structure.
              </p>
              <p>
                If momentum returns, Bitcoin has the potential to soar higher
                because there are not any nearby resistance zones. However, the
                opposite is also true: the asset is extremely susceptible to
                steep declines in the event that bulls lose control because
                there is not an immediate support buffer until approximately
                $89,000.
              </p>
              <p>
                With the RSI at 68, which is getting close to the overbought
                threshold, momentum is still strong but may be peaking. But the
                volume remains low, which is a warning sign. In the absence of
                increased participation, this breakout could turn into a bull
                trap. The course of the subsequent volatility spike will
                determine everything that happens next.
              </p>
              <p>
                A new leg up that might target the psychological $100,000 level
                and beyond could be started by a clean break above $97,000 with
                high volume. Alternatively, a collapse below the $93,000-$92,000
                range would probably lead to $89,000 or even lower, indicating
                the end of this rally and possibly igniting a general market
                correction.
              </p>
              <p>
                Bitcoin is perched on the edge of a tight market. Since no
                safety net is in sight, the next big move — up or down — will
                not merely be another leg; rather, it will determine the
                framework for the cycle’s subsequent phase. Hold on tight
                because this level of calm is short-lived.

              </h2>
              <p>
                As it tests the upper limit of a descending channel that has
                characterized its price action since January 2025, XRP is poised
                for a significant move. Just below the $2.40 resistance, a
                crucial level that, if broken, could lead to a volatility
                breakout, the asset is currently trading at about $2.37, up
                2.12% for the day.
              </p>
              <p>
                With declining volume suggesting that a breakout — or breakdown
                — is imminent, the chart clearly shows that XRP is compressing
                toward the tip of a wedge following months of lower highs and
                lower lows. The fact that XRP has surpassed all three major
                moving averages, the 50, 100 and 200 EMA, and that they are now
                converging around the $2.20 region, is encouraging for bulls.
              </p>
              <p>
                This confluence serves as a dynamic floor of support. Because
                the asset is not yet overbought, the RSI remains neutral at 55,
                providing it with room to rise sharply. The volume is still low,
                but given how swiftly XRP moves when sentiment changes, any
                increase in buying interest around $2.40 could spark a quick
                rally to the $2.80-$3.00 region.
              </p>
              <p>
                Technically speaking, XRP is acting in a positive way. It made a
                clean recovery from the April bottom of the wedge and is now
                marking higher lows, which suggests that buyers are intervening
                more forcefully. The consolidation that is occurring close to
                the top of the descending channel is an indication of increasing

              </h2>
              <p>
                With its strong 3.14% daily gain, Ethereum has pushed to $1,850,
                igniting cautious optimism about a wider recovery. This rally
                might not be as strong as it first appears, at least not yet,
                according to a closer examination of the market environment and
                chart structure. As of right now, ETH is trading just above its
                50-day EMA, which it recently flipped into support.
              </p>
              <p>
                Generally speaking a sustained breakout above this level is a
                bullish indication, particularly when combined with price
                consolidation close to the top. The 100 EMA, which is at $2,148,
                and the 200 EMA, which is at $2,469, represent the next
                important test. These moving averages could confirm a reversal
                and restore medium-term bullish momentum if they break cleanly.
                The problem is that the volume is not very impressive.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although Ethereum’s price is rising, the stability of this trend
                is undermined by the lack of robust buying activity. Significant
                ETH reversals in the past have been marked by spikes in volume
                and volatility, neither of which is present at the moment. This
                means that if the mood of the market changes or if Bitcoin
                begins to correct, the current move could be quickly reversed.
              </p>
              <p>
                The RSI, which is at 59, indicates that ETH has some leeway
                before hitting overbought levels, but it might not mean much if
                volume does not increase. Although it is speculative at best
                without confirmation, this could be seen as quiet accumulation.
                Overall, the recovery is brittle even though Ethereum is
                displaying early indications of strength.
              </p>
              <p>
                With increasing volume and volatility, ETH must decisively break
                through the 100 EMA for the market to fully embrace a bullish
                narrative. Until then, it would be more accurate to consider
                this move a cautious bounce rather than a complete trend
                reversal. Keep a close eye on the $2,150 zone; it will determine
                ETH’s short-term destiny.

                MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Russian rouble strengthened past 81 to
                the U.S. dollar, supported by rising oil prices, reaching its
                highest level since June 28, 2024.
              </p>
              <p>
                At 0900 GMT the rouble was up 1.5% 80.90 to the U.S. currency in
                thin trade ahead of the Orthodox Easter holiday. The price for
                oil, Russia’s main commodity, rose by 3% on April 17.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Russian currency is up by over 40% against the dollar since
                the start of the year, mainly on expectation of easing of
                tensions between Russia and the United States.
              </p>
              <p>
                The rouble has ignored the statement by U.S. Secretary of State
                Marco Rubio, that President Donald Trump will walk away from
                trying to broker a Russia-Ukraine peace deal within days unless
                there are clear signs that a deal can be done.

                substantial unrealized losses, the data also indicates that
                long-term holders are still broadly in profit. However, mounting
                unrealized losses are putting even these seasoned holders at
                risk of losing their gains.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unrealized losses represent the total amount of losses held
                across all Bitcoin in circulation, calculated from the
                difference between the average acquisition cost and the current
                market value.

              </h2>
              <p>
                As the crypto market moves with caution amid debates about the
                sustainability of the recent bull run, the rise in unrealized
                loss per percent drawdown has captured the attention of both
                retail and institutional investors.
              </p>
              <p>
                According to the data, repeated price corrections across the
                broader crypto market have not yet signaled sustainable bullish
                momentum. Meanwhile, Bitcoin appears to be following a
                historical bearish pattern observed in previous cycles.

                Glassnode revealed that the unrealized losses faced by
                short-term holders are a direct response to the recent market
                dips.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although these corrections are not as sharp as those in earlier
                cycles that triggered full-blown bear markets, the resemblance
                in pattern has sparked speculation that a bearish phase may
                already be underway.
              </p>
              <p>
                For long-term holders, the data painted a mixed picture. While
                they remain largely in profit, they are now vulnerable to
                absorbing losses if downward momentum persists.

                    Notably, the increasing number of top Bitcoin buyers
                    maturing into long-term holders could help the market

                Although this key metric has historically aligned with bear
                market confirmations, it alone does not officially define one.
                Despite these bearish indicators, Bitcoin whales and major
                investment firms have not slowed down in their accumulation
                efforts.

                The bearish trend for the US dollar (USD) is gaining momentum
                following a significant selloff last week.
              </p>
              <p>
                According to BofA, the Option Flow and Technical Matrix, both
                indicate signs of a continuing bearish USD trend against
                European currencies, the Canadian dollar (CAD), and the Japanese
                yen (JPY) in the G10 group.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are indications of a structural weakness in the USD.
                Despite short-term fair values suggesting the USD was oversold
                at the start of last week, as reported on FX Watch on April 9,
                2025, the supply of USD in the foreign exchange (FX) market has
                continued unabated.
              </p>
              <p>
                Investors in the FX market are likely shifting their focus
                beyond short-term valuations. They may seek to drive the USD
                weaker until it approaches long-term equilibrium levels, as
                noted in FX Viewpoint on September 11, 2024.
              </p>
              <p>
                Furthermore, a time zone analysis reveals that the recent USD
                weakness has been mainly concentrated during trading hours in
                Europe and Asia.
              </p>
              <p>
                Interestingly, the USD selloff has become independent of the
                Federal Reserve’s rate cut pricing. This suggests that the
                selling of USD in non-US hours is continuing, contributing to
                the bearish USD trend.
